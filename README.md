# SlipInfo
 Adds automatic pronouns for crew members in [Slipstream: Rogue Space](https://playslipstream.com). Currently only compatible with players who signed in using Twitch and have configured pronouns [here](https://pr.alejo.io/). (To be clear: It is not required that you sign in with Twitch, just that the person the plugin looks up pronouns for is. It will not show anything for non-Twitch players.)

 Pronouns will appear wherever possible, usually right after the player's name.

 Pronouns are cached until the game restarts, so keep that in mind.
